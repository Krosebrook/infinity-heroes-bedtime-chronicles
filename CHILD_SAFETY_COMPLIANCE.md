# Child Safety & UX Guardrails (7-9 Age Group)

Infinity Heroes is designed with a "Safety First, Creativity Always" philosophy.

## 1. Safety Guardrails
- **Prompt Filtering**: System instructions explicitly forbid violence, fear, dark themes, or real-world brands.
- **No Social Friction**: Zero sharing, zero comments, zero external links. The experience is contained within the "Memory Jar."
- **Privacy**: No user data (hero names, settings, recordings) is ever transmitted to a central server other than the Google Gemini endpoint. All stories are stored locally on the device's IndexedDB.

## 2. Accessibility
- **Target Sizes**: All buttons are minimum 48x48px (touch-friendly).
- **Audio Navigation**: Narration is primary, allowing low-literacy children to enjoy the stories independently.
- **Cognitive Load**: Split-view "Wizard" setup for hero creation to avoid complex forms.

## 3. Emotional Comfort
- **No Failure States**: Every choice leads to a heroic or interesting outcome. There is no "Game Over."
- **Soothing Design**: Sleepy mode uses Indigo/Midnight color palettes to reduce blue light exposure before bed.
