    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>
    <p><strong>Infinity Heroes: Bedtime Chronicles</strong> ("the App") is developed and maintained by Infinity Heroes ("we", "us", or "our"). This privacy policy explains how the App handles information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>This App is designed for children ages 7-9. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and all applicable children's privacy laws.</p>
    <p><strong>We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under 13.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No account creation or sign-up is required.</li>
      <li>No names, email addresses, or other personal identifiers are collected.</li>
      <li>No photos, videos, or audio recordings are collected from users.</li>
      <li>No location data is collected.</li>
      <li>No cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies are used.</li>
      <li>No advertising is displayed in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All story content, hero profiles, and user preferences are stored <strong>locally on the device</strong> using the browser's IndexedDB storage. This data never leaves the device and is not transmitted to any server. Users can delete all locally stored data at any time by clearing the App's data in their device settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the <strong>Google Gemini API</strong> to generate bedtime story content. When a story is requested:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A text prompt describing the story scenario is sent to the Google Gemini API.</li>
      <li>No personal information, user identifiers, or device identifiers are included in these requests.</li>
      <li>The prompts contain only fictional story parameters (hero name chosen by the user, story theme, and story mode).</li>
      <li>Google's use of this data is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other third-party services, SDKs, analytics platforms, or advertising networks are used.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties. No personal data exists to share.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All communications between the App and the Google Gemini API are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS. Since no personal data is collected or stored on our servers, there is no risk of a data breach involving personal information.</p>

    <h2>Parental Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information from children, there is no personal data to review, modify, or delete. All app-generated content is stored locally on the device and can be deleted by clearing the App's data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage parents and guardians to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
